    <h1>West African Mythology</h1>
    <p>
      Anansi, in the form of spider, once decided to hoard the entire world’s
      wisdom in a pot for himself. When he succeeded, he attempted to hide the
      pot at the top of a tree where nobody could find it. He tied the pot in
      front of him and tried to climb the tree, but kept sliding and losing his
      grip. His son, who had followed him, suggested he tie the pot to his back
      so he could climb more easily. When Anansi tried to implement his son’s
      suggestion, the pot slipped and fell to the ground. The wisdom fell out
      and a sudden rainstorm washed it into the river and from there to the
      waters of the ocean, so that everyone in the world now owns a little bit
      of it.
