      Cost of wisdom: The story of god-king Odin and his sacrifices for
      spiritual growth
    </h1>

        Odin was the king of the Aesir tribe, simultaneously god of war and
        earth as well as god of sky, wisdom, poetry and magic. He was shamanic,
        a lover of ecstasy, and trance, and often ‘effeminate’, embarrassing the
        Viking warriors who preferred his masculine side. One of the most
        striking attributes of his appearance is his single, piercing eye. His
        other eye socket is empty – the eye it once held was sacrificed for
        wisdom. He gave it up so he could drink from the well of wisdom. On
        another occasion, Odin hung on the world-tree Yggdrasil for nine days
        and nights, receiving no form of nourishment from his companions,
        sacrificing himself to himself, so that in the end he perceived the
        runes, the magically-charged ancient Germanic alphabet that was held to
        contain many of the greatest secrets of existence.
